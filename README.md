### About me
Developer with almost 5 years experience in the software development business. Most of that time has been spent on iOS development, which is also what I'm absolutely most passionate about.

During my short career I've worked on several native iOS apps dealing with maps and user location, persisting data on device, branding multiple targets, localization and more.

Science fiction enthusiast. Frequent runner, training to complete a marathon. Father of one. Husband. Cat person.
